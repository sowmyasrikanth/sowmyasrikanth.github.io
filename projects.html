								<h2><b>Java</b></h2>
								<ul>
									<li> <b>Optimized Search in Large Databases:</b>
										<p>Developed an algorithm that used quad trees to optimally search for a particular element in a large unsorted database.
   										   By constructing a k-d tree from the unsorted data, the search was restricted to only those buckets that contained the element.
										   Gene and MRA data for a sample set of people was used to test the algorithm and Pearsons coefficient was used as distance measure.</p></li>
									<li> <b>Buffer Management in Postgres SQL:</b>
										<p>Implemented the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy for buffer management in Postgres SQL, which replaced the clock
										   replacement policy that was already implemented in Postgres 8.2.1. </p></li>
									<li> <b>Performance Adaptive - UDP:</b>
										<p>Developed a UDP protocol that enabled high speed bulk data transfer, using a rate control algorithm. 
										   This project was developed in collaboration with the Aeronautical Defence Establishment, Bangalore as a final year undergraduate project.</p></li>
								</ul>
								<h2><b>C</b></h2>
								<ul>
									<li> <b>Local Grid Project (Masters thesis):</b>
										<p>Kindly refer to my thesis page for details on this project</p></li>
                                    					<li><b> Update Service Protocol:</b>
										<p>Designed, Implemented and Evaluated an application-level protocol that periodically sends an update message
    									           from the server to a group of registered clients via the Internet.  </p></li>
									<li> <b>Smart Switch:</b>
										<p> Developed and Evauated an algorithm using csim for trading-off between performance (delay) and energy
 										    comsumption in a system that consists of two links (100Mbps drawing 1W and 1Gbps drawing 10W). </p></li>
									<li> <b>Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB):</b>
										<p> By determining the time taken to access the TLB (recording both hits and misses), the size of the TLB
										    was ascertained.Developed in C, this project focused on the TLB hierarchy, disabling compiler optimization
											to get accurate results and determine the size of the TLB.</p></li>
									<li> <b>File System Parameters:</b>
										<p> The underlying file system plays a key role in the performance of the system. In this project, the various
										    file system parameters were determined such as block size of the disk, the number of direct pointers, file
											cache size and size of the prefetched data has been recorded, using C. Based on these results, one could
											determine the file system being used.</p></li>
								</ul>
								<h2><b>Miscellaneous</b></h2>
								<ul>
									<li> <b>Network Interdiction in Cybersecurity:</b>
										<p>Investigated the various interdition models in graph theory and their application in cybersecurity. Implemented a
										   branch and bound algorithm using iGraphs, that solves the shortest path network interdiction model - focusing on the
										   application of such an approximation solution in cybersecurity in smart grids. </p></li>
									<li> <b>Broadcast Traffic Characterization:</b>
										<p>Characterized the broadcast traffic received on the Ethernet port of the campus LAN, focusing on the overhead on the
										   network bandwidth and processing delays at the host.  </p></li>
								</ul>
